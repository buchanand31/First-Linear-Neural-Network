# Linear-Neural-Network

This is my first, ever, neural network. This short code takes input and guesses at the output. Since this is a basic linear model, 
  it will almost always get it correct. The goal is for given inputs (x, y), to output (2x + 3y). This is my first implementation of
  a neural network, and more advanced models are to come.
